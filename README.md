# Serverless REST API using AWS (API Gateway, Lambda, DynamoDB, Cognito)

## Project Overview
This project is a **secure, serverless backend REST API** built using AWS services.  
It allows:
- Anyone to **read data** (public access)
- Only authenticated users to **create data**

The project demonstrates how modern cloud applications build scalable backends **without managing servers**, using managed AWS services and JWT-based authentication.

This backend can be consumed by:
- Web applications (React, Angular, etc.)
- Mobile apps
- Internal company tools
- Other backend services

---

## High-Level Architecture

Client (curl / frontend app)  
→ API Gateway (HTTP API)  
→ AWS Lambda (Python)  
→ DynamoDB  

Authentication flow:
- Amazon Cognito User Pool
- JWT token validation via API Gateway Authorizer

---

## AWS Services Used
- **Amazon API Gateway (HTTP API)** – Exposes REST endpoints
- **AWS Lambda (Python 3.12)** – Executes backend logic
- **Amazon DynamoDB** – Stores application data
- **Amazon Cognito User Pool** – User authentication and JWT tokens
- **AWS CloudWatch** – Logging and monitoring

---

## Authentication & Security
- Cognito User Pool with a **public SPA app client**
- JWT Authorizer configured in API Gateway
- `POST /items` is protected (authentication required)
- `GET` endpoints are public
- No secrets or credentials stored in code
- Configuration handled via environment variables

---

## API Endpoints

The API exposes endpoints for reading and creating items. Read operations are public, while write operations require authentication using a JWT token issued by Amazon Cognito.

### Public Endpoints

- **GET /items**  
  Returns a list of all stored items.

- **GET /items/{id}**  
  Returns a single item matching the provided ID.

### Protected Endpoint (Authentication Required)

- **POST /items**  
  Creates a new item in the database.  
  Requires an Authorization header with a valid Cognito ID token.


---

## Example API Calls

Create a new item (authenticated request):

curl -X POST https://<api-id>.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/items \
-H "Authorization: Bearer <ID_TOKEN>" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"name":"milk","price":3}'

## Retrieve all items:
curl https://<api-id>.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/items

## Retrieve a single item by ID:
curl https://<api-id>.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/items/<item-id>


## Lambda Functions Overview

## Lambda Function	                                     Responsibility

CreateItemFunction	                                 Validates input and stores data in DynamoDB
ListItemsFunction	                                   Retrieves all items from DynamoDB
GetItemFunction	                                     Retrieves a single item by ID

Each Lambda function follows the single-responsibility principle and is mapped to a specific API route.

## Data Model (DynamoDB)

Each item stored in DynamoDB follows this structure:
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "name": "milk",
  "price": 3
}
-id is the partition key
-UUID is generated by the backend
-DynamoDB uses on-demand capacity mode

## Key Learnings

Built a production-style serverless backend

Implemented JWT-based authentication using Amazon Cognito

Secured APIs at the API Gateway layer

Designed RESTful APIs with protected write operations

Handled DynamoDB Decimal serialization in Python

Gained hands-on experience with AWS serverless architecture

## Future Enhancements

Infrastructure as Code using Terraform or CloudFormation

Pagination support for DynamoDB scan operations

Stronger input validation using schemas

Rate limiting and AWS WAF integration

CI/CD pipeline for automated deployments
